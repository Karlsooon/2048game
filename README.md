# Game 2048

This is a simple implementation of the popular game 2048 using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

The goal of the game is to combine tiles with the same value to create a tile with the value of 2048.

To play the game, use the arrow keys to move the tiles in the corresponding direction. All tiles will move in the same direction until they reach the edge of the game board or collide with another tile.

When two tiles with the same value collide, they merge into a single tile with the sum of their values.

The game is over when there are no more moves available or when a tile with the value of 2048 is created.

## Bot

There is a button in the game to start the bot. The bot will automatically play the game by simulating arrow key presses until the game is over.

## How to Run

To run the game, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
